# Java Object Serialization Examples

This repository contains examples of writing and reading Java objects to and from files without using Java's built-in serialization mechanism. The examples demonstrate how to manually convert object data to a text format and store it in a file, both with and without buffering for performance optimization.

## Contents

- `Person.java`: A simple class representing a person with `name` and `age` fields.
- `WriteObjectsWithoutBuffer.java`: Example of writing objects to a file without using buffering.
- `WriteObjectsWithBuffer.java`: Example of writing objects to a file with buffering.
- `ReadObjectsFromFile.java`: Example of reading objects from a file and reconstructing them.
